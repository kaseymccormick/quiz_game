<h2> What is the data-type (e.g. string or integer) of the information that comes in? What happens if the user inputs a number -- does it stay an integer? Use typeof and console.log() to help with this.</h2>
  <p>string, no it goes to string</p>
  
<h2>What happens if the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent) without typing anything in? What information gets assigned to a variable, if any?</h2>
<p> it collects the example text or the empty string</p>

<h2>How did you choose your variable names? If you gave a list of variable names to someone who hasn't seen your code, could they reasonably predict what information you might store in each?</h2>
<p>I decided i was collecting information from a user so wanted to define where the information was coming from so i chose user as prefix then the type of information after hence userAge. Yes I beleive they would understand</p>
  
<h2>If you completely changed a question you were asking the user, would it make sense to totally rename the variable? What if you changed the order of your questions?</h2>
<p>Yes the variable name defines what information is being collected therefore if the question changes the definition should change information.</p>
  
<h2>In these exercises, we use prompt() to collect information, but most websites do that ask for information do not use prompt() -- how do they collect information (what HTML elements do they use)? What might be an advantage to doing it that way instead of with prompt()? Are there any disadvantages? Why might you use prompt()?</h2>
<p>they use input type text via html or checkboxes etc. This is not as obtrusive as prompts. propts are helpful for information that should be an alert or security required. for example login</p>
  
<h2>Research prompt() -- is there any way to make it so that there are two (or more) fields?</h2>
<p>doesn't seem to be without some other tool jquary etc</p>

<h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
<p>the question about completely changed a question would you change the variable elicits, should i not have to?</p>

<h2>Note</h2>
<p>when the prompt just collects the default value when it alerts and recalls the info it returns null</p>
