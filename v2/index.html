<p>  Using Javascript, add the first question's content to div#question. So when you load the page, the first question's content should already be there.
  Do the same thing for the question's choices (into div#choices).
  Okay so now you have a non-functional quiz game, but at least it's showing the user the first question and choices. And there is a field for the user to enter their answer (and a button to submit it), but that doesn't actually do anything yet. So let's fix that. (After this, we'll worry about going through multiple questions â€“ for now, we'll deal with the first question alone.)
