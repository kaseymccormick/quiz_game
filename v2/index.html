Write a function called process_answer_submission. It should look something like this:
function process_answer_submission(){
  var user_answer = given_answer();
  update_question_result(is_correct_answer(user_answer));
}
Now we want that function to run whenever button#submitter is clicked. You might need to do some research to figure this out. Hint: What you're trying to do here is attach an "event handler" to the button. The "event" is "click". So you're trying to define how the button handles being clicked. Specifically, you're trying to say that the behavior of the button, when it's clicked, should be as described in the process_answer_submission function.
